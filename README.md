## Lab Questions

### In plain English describe the function and use of a multiplexer.
    A multiplexer has inputs a selector and an output. The selector is used to pick what input is used for the output. A multiplexer can be used for a variety of things like choosing which data to send or as a track selector at a junction in a railroad where multiple tracks can lead into one track. On a train track you often have multiple tracks leading into a single track. The multiple tracks coming in could serve as the inputs for the multiplexer. Then there is a selector, a signal that determines what incoming track will be picked to lead into the single track (the output).

### In plain English describe the function and use of a demultiplexer.
    The function of a demultiplexer is to decompress the data to its original state, like the receiving
    machine from a data transfer.
